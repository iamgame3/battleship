# Battleship

This app is meant to teach me how to utilise TDD using Jest.

Enter player names, and select if you want to play against an AI or not (will take the place of player two, and may still have some rare bugs). Place your ships through the randomiser, and click on the small grid to attack the enemy.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
